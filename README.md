COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Impacts at the period **(12/31/20219 to 10/19/2020)**. The dataset contains information about various aspects of the pandemic, including total cases, total deaths, stringency index, population, GDP per capita, and more.

Objectives
The main objectives of this EDA are:
-Gain insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19 across different locations.
-Analyze the relationship between key variables like stringency index, population, and GDP per capita.
-Identify trends and patterns over time.

Key Findings
- Correlation Analysis: Explored correlations between various variables to understand relationships.
- Comparative Analysis: Compared statistics across different locations to identify trends and outliers.
- Time Series Analysis: Visualized the progression of total cases and total deaths over time.
